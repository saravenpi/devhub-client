## What is DevHub:

I'm not the author of DevHub (its creators are [driaug](https://github.com/driaug) and [boon-cpu](https://github.com/boon-cpu)). Let me tell you a story: I was scrolling on Reddit, and saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/lxtine/devhub_the_backend_only_social_media/), the concept is a "backend only" social media, designed for the programmers.
So I wanted to make a client for the app!

## How it looks like:

## Online deploy:

### There is a online deploy currently running on Heroku, [here](https://devhub-client.herokuapp.com)

## How to use it:

- You just have to clone it and make sure to have [node](https://nodejs.org) installed and also [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (the node package manager)
- then start the command `npm install` to install the dependencies
- then you can start `npm start` to start the project it will start the website on your localhost.

And you will see the website accessible localy in your webrowser with the show port or you can deploy it online for  instance on heroku, now you are ready to go!
